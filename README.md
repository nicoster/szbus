# Introducing szbus
A nodejs project which powers a website where you query the bus status in Suzhou. 


## How Do I Use It?
Before I find a website hosting this project, you could only play with it in your computer.

Here is the steps (in OSX. similar for other platform. assume you have node, npm installed)
```javascript
git clone git@github.com:nicoster/szbus.git
cd szbus/
npm install
node app.js
</script>
```

It's done. Fire up a modern browser like Chrome and navigate to 'localhost:3000' and have fun.

## What needs to be done?
* CSS decoration
* Favorites editing
* Mobile device support
* UI refactoring (more ajax-like)
* more.. 

## Changelog
* _Jan.12 
  * Very basic feature set has been implemented
