# Introducing szbus
A nodejs project which powers a website where you query the bus status in Suzhou, a city close to ShangHai in China.


## How Do I Use It?
Before I find a website hosting this project, you could only play with it in your computer.

Here are the steps (in OSX. similar for other platform. assume you have node 0.6.x, npm 1.1.x, mongo installed)

    git clone git@github.com:nicoster/szbus.git
    cd szbus/
    npm install
    node app.js


If nothing goes wrong, it's done. Fire up a modern browser like Chrome and navigate to 'localhost:3000' and have fun.

## What needs to be done?
* CSS decoration
* Favorites editing
* Mobile device support
* UI refactoring (more ajax-like)
* more.. 

If you found this project is fun and may help someone, fork it and make it better.

## Changelog
* _Jan. 2012_ 
  * Very basic feature set has been implemented
